## Hi there 👋, I'm Germano Pansini

I am a Computer Engineering graduate with a Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from the Polytechnic University of Bari, and a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering. During my academic path, I worked on multiple research and project-based activities, developing solid expertise in computer vision, robotics perception, embedded systems, and simulation-driven development.

As part of my postgraduate experience, I contributed to applied research projects in precision agriculture and autonomous robotics, working on real-world data acquisition, deep-learning-based perception pipelines, and autonomy-oriented prototyping. My work spans from model development to deployment on embedded platforms, with a strong focus on integrating perception, sensing, and navigation components.

My technical background centers on Python and C++ for AI and robotics applications, with extensive experience using PyTorch, ROS, and NVIDIA simulation tools to design, validate, and test perception systems. My interests focus on autonomous robotics, vision-based scene understanding, and digital-twin environments for perception and navigation.
