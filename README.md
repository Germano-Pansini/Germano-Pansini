## Hi there 👋, I'm Germano Pansini

I’m an engineer with a **B.Sc. in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering** and an **M.Sc. in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science)** from the Polytechnic University of Bari.

My background sits at the intersection of **computer vision, perception for robotics, embedded systems, and simulation-driven development**.  
I enjoy working on problems where sensing, data, and intelligent decision-making meet the physical world.

During my academic and postgraduate research experience, I worked on **applied AI projects** ranging from precision agriculture to autonomous robotics, focusing on **vision-based perception pipelines**, real-world data acquisition, and system-level integration. I’m particularly interested in how AI models behave once deployed on real platforms, not just in notebooks.
